# treasurydata

This console application scrapes the Brazilian Treasury Direct website and shows a table with basic data about the available government bonds.

## Installation and use

Clone this repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danilogalisteu/bd-05-pp-treasurydata.git
```

The application uses [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the Javascript runtime, [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for runtime version management and `npm`for package dependency management.

To initialize the application environment, change to the `bd-05-pp-treasurydata` folder, run:
```bash
nvm use
```
to activate the correct version of `node`, and run:
```bash
npm install
```
to install all dependencies. The application depends on the following packages:
* `puppeteer` for web scraping (requires Google Chrome available on the system);
* `blessed`and `blessed-contrib` for the graphical user interface package; and
* `danfojs-node` for data manipulation.
Its tests depend on the `jest`package.
